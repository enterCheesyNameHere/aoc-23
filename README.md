# Advent of Code 2023

My repo containing all my work for the 2023 advent of code.
Trying to do it in languages I'm not as familiar with or in languages I need to do better in.

I've used clion and wsl for this so far, so I left the run configurations in the .idea folder to set this up easier elsewhere. There's a config for each day in there.
